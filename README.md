## Ferrite

Ferrite is a toolkit for developing file system crash-consistency models, as described in our ASPLOS'16 paper [*Specifying and Checking File System Crash-Consistency Models*][paper].

This repository contains the Ferrite toolkit for developing crash-consistency models, and proof-of-concept verification and synthesis tools that use the resulting models.
